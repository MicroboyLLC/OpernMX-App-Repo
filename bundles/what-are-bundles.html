    <h1>What are OpenMX Store Bundles?</h1>
    <p>An OpenMX Store Bundle is like an EXE file on Windows, a RPM file on Linux, or aN APP file (or rather folder) on macOS. It is like those because it is used to run apps. Just larger apps. We have an OpenMX Store package manager that has its own currency called MXCoin. It <i>is</i> crypto, but an Ethereum token is more like what it is. You can sell .mxb files for MXCoin, but yoiu need to specify in the storeMeta.conf file that you have to pay for ity, and how much MXCoin you need to buy it. MXCoin is coming in version 6 of the OS (or when the OpenMX Scratch project updates to version 6.0).</p>
    <h2>I downloaded a bundle, bu6 how do I open it?</h2>
    <p>First, use the command <b>mxb</b> (put it in angle brackets). You can then enter the app name.</p>
    <h2>How can I download a bundle from the web?</h2>
    <p>First of all, <b>that can be very dangerous, and OpenMX App Bundles should be moved to the storeApps directory using the command python (put in angle brackets), then enter "import shutil" (without the quotes), then use the same command again, but use "shutil.move(appName.mxb, "storeApps")" as the code instead (the first and last quote marks should be ignored in the full command).</b> Second of all, In order to run it for the first time, you need to connect to the internet to download the libraries and to use the command. Last of all, it may be badly coded and/or have a bad metadata.conf file!</p>
    <p>What do we think about it? It should <b>only</b> be used <b>only</b> if needed! Re rtecommend the OpenMX Store. You can download more than just OpenMX Store Bundles though, especially if the app needs some resources for itself, but you may need to move them into the MXBTemp folder if using OpenMX Store Bundles. You could even move it to a non-app folder, although it <b>should</b> be in the apps folder or its subfolders.</p>
    <h2>Can you make paid OpenMX apps?</h2>
    <p>Of course you can! You may want to make a launher app that detects if you paid for a paid app's license key, and a free installer outside of the OpenMX Store. It could also install a .mxb file in the storeApps folder.</p>
